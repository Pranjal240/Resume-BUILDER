Simple Interactive Resume Builder

This is a straightforward, client-side resume builder built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The project allows users to dynamically input their personal and professional information into a form and see it reflected in a styled resume template in real-time.

Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to provide a simple and intuitive interface for creating a professional-looking resume without needing a complex backend or database. All data is handled on the client-side, meaning the information you enter is processed directly in your web browser. The resume updates instantly as you type, providing immediate visual feedback.

Simple Customization: 
Includes basic styling options, such as changing the color theme of the generated resume.

Pure Front-End:
Built entirely with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and DOM manipulation. No external libraries or frameworks are required.

Responsive Design:
